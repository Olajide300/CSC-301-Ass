QUESTIONS:
1.) Using a recursion, get a sum of first ten numbers.
2.) Write a Fibonacci series of 8 
3.) Dynamic Array: 
	Insert the following values into a dynamic arrays of capacity 2 
	values  = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50.
4.) Linear and Binar Search: 
 	Perform a linear search on an array with; 
	Values = 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 20.	Target is 10.
5.) Binary Search.
	Place the binary search in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13. Target is 9
-- State the time & space complexit of both.

ANSWER:
1. Here’s how to get the sum of the first ten natural numbers (1–10) using recursion.
	function sum(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n + sum(n - 1)
	sum(10)
# Output: 55

2. Here is the Fibonacci series of the first 8 terms;
	Fibonacci Series (8 terms): 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
	
	# Fibonacci series of 8 terms
n = 8
a, b = 0, 1

print("Fibonacci Series:")

for i in range(n):
    print(a, end=" ")
    a, b = b, a + b


3. Inserting 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 into an initial array of capacity = 2.

A dynamic array automatically doubles its capacity when it becomes full.
	✅ Initial State
	Capacity = 2
	Size = 0
	Array = [  ,  ]

	👉 Insert 10
	Fits in current capacity
	Array → [10, _ ]
	Size = 1

	👉 Insert 20
	Still fits
  	Array → [10, 20]
 	 Size = 2

	👉 Insert 30
	Array is full → capacity doubles to 4
	New array created → [10, 20, _ , _ ]
	Insert 30
	Array → [10, 20, 30, _ ]
	Size = 3

	👉 Insert 40
	Fits in capacity 4
 	 Array → [10, 20, 30, 40]
  	Size = 4

	👉 Insert 50
	 Array full → capacity doubles to 8
  	New array → [10, 20, 30, 40, _ , _ , _ , _ ]
  	Insert 50
  	Array → [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, _ , _ , _ ]
  	Size = 5

	✅ Final Dynamic Array
	[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, _, _, _]

Final size: 5
Final capacity: 8

4. Linear Search
	Array: `[2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 20]`
	Target: `10`
Linear search checks each element one-by-one from the start until it finds the target.

🔍Step-by-Step Search
| Index | Value | Comparison  | Result    |
| ----- | -----        | -----------        | --------- |
| 0     | 2             | 2 == 10? ❌  | Continue  |
| 1     | 5             | 5 == 10? ❌  | Continue  |
| 2     | 7             | 7 == 10? ❌  | Continue  |
| 3     | 10          | 10 == 10? ✅ | FOUND |

Conclusion: The target 10 was found at index 3 (4th position in the array).

5. Below is the Binary Search performed on the array:

 🔍 Binary Search
Array (sorted): [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
Target: 9


# 🐍 Python Code for Binary Search

```python
# Binary Search in Python

values = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
target = 9

def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2

        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return -1   # target not found

# Run the search
index = binary_search(values, target)

if index != -1:
    print(f"Target {target} found at index {index}.")
else:
    print("Target not found.")


Time & Space Complexity

Linear Search
	Time Complexity: O(n)
  (Worst case: check every element)
	Space Complexity: O(1)
  (No extra memory used)

Binary Search
 	Time Complexity: O(log n)
  (Each step divides the array by 2)
	Space Complexity:
  Iterative version: O(1)
  Recursive version: O(log n) [because of call stack]
